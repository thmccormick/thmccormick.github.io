I'm currently an Associate Professor of [Statistics](http://www.stat.washington.edu/) and [Sociology](https://soc.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](http://www.uw.edu).  I'm also a core faculty member in the [Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences](http://csss.washington.edu/) and a Senior Data Science Fellow at the [eScience Institute](http://escience.washington.edu/).  
<br>
I'm the current Editor of the [Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=editorialBoard&journalCode=ucgs20). I'm excited and humbled to be a 2019 recipient of the [NIH Director's New Innovator Award](https://commonfund.nih.gov/newinnovator).
<br><br>
My research covers a variety of topics in statistics and data science, typically motivated by scientific questions in global health, economics, demography, and sociology. More information about OpenVA, our suite of open tools to manage and analyze verbal autopsy surveys, is available [here](http://openva.net/).
