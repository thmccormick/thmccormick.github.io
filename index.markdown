 My research covers a variety of topics in statistics and data science, typically motivated by scientific questions in global health, economics, demography, and sociology. Recent projects include estimating features of social networks (e.g. the degree of clustering or how central an individual is) using data from standard surveys, inferring a likely cause of death (when deaths happen outside of
hospitals) using reports from surviving caretakers, and quantifying & communicating uncertainty
in predictive models for global health policymakers. More information about OpenVA, our suite of open tools to manage and analyze verbal autopsy surveys, is available [here](http://openva.net/).

I'm the former Editor of the [Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=editorialBoard&journalCode=ucgs20) and a 2019 recipient of the [NIH Director's New Innovator Award](https://commonfund.nih.gov/newinnovator).  I was elected as a [Fellow](https://stat.uw.edu/news-resources/articles/adrian-dobra-and-tyler-mccormick-elected-2023-asa-fellows) of the [American Statistical Association](https://www.amstat.org/your-career/awards/asa-fellows) in 2023.

An description of some of our work recently appeared in the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/you-probably-know-611-people-heres-how-we-know-88dd27d9?mod=wsjhp_columnists_pos2) and it was used for a [visual story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2024/gaza-numbers-killed-displaced-scale/?itid=ap_alyssafowers) in the Washington Post.
