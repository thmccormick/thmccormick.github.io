In such settings, many deaths happen outside of medical facilities and are not officially documented by a medical professional. VA surveys, consisting of signs and symptoms reported by a person close to the decedent, are used to infer the cause of death for an individual, and to estimate and monitor the cause of death distribution in the population. There are three components required for analyzing VAs: (i) VA survey data, (ii) inputs that give information about the association between symptoms and causes, and (iii) a statistical or algorithmic method for assigning a likely cause. For each of these pieces, there are several variants produced independently by research and policy organizations. Incompatibility between components means that there is no systematic way of applying and comparing different methods without laborious, idiosyncratic data conversion. The openVA package aims to simplify comparison across existing VA tools through a standardized pipeline that is compatible with all openly available methods and data structure. It provides an open-sourced, R implementation of four most widely used VA methods: InterVA-4, InSilicoVA, Naive Bayes Classifier, and Tariff. It supports different data input and output formats, and customizable in- formation about the associations between causes and symptoms. The paper discusses the relevant algorithms, the implementations in R and some additional information on advanced model fitting with InSilicoVA.\n CRAN. Website. Slides from WHO VA Working Group.

I\u0026rsquo;m excited to work with motivated students in many different areas, but students must first be admitted to the PhD program. If you have specific questions about the admission process please contact the Director of Graduate Studies (information available on the department homepage). If you\u0026rsquo;re already admitted to the UW program, please send me an email! Postdoctoral collaborators Please get in touch to find out if there are opportunities available. Typically if I have a position available there will be an advertisement on statistics jobs boards such as the University of Florida or the ISBA jobs board.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"cbf8f25849683bb7f1176dfe94313a03","permalink":"https://thmccormick.github.io/class/students/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/class/students/","section":"class","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m eager to work with student and postdoctoral collaborators!

If you have data from your own research, you\u0026rsquo;re welcome to use it.\nLab: Hands on practice with network data. Labs count as part of homeworks.\nCollaborative work: Working together is highly encouraged! Each student must, however, turn in their own homework using Github (see below). Writing must be your own, or appropriately cited.\nPolicies:\n Only assignments turned in through Github will count for credit. More info below.\n All empirical assignments must also include code. More info below. Late assignments accepted with at 10% per day penalty.  In-class: I highly discourage the use of laptops during lecture, as I find them very distracting for me and for other students. If you need to use your phone or are otherwise feeling distracted, please step outside.\nSubmitting code:\n You must sign up for a Github account. I recommend applying for an educational discount. All assignments must be submitted through Github. Your code should stand alone. More information here. I suggest following the tidyverse style guide.  Academic accommodations: To request academic accommodations due to disability, please contact Disabled Student Services, 448 Schmitz Hall, (206) 543-8924. Myself and your TA will be happy to provide academic accommodations if you have a letter requesting such from Disability Resources for Students (DRS). Please feel free to see me during office hours to discuss this.\nRelated courses: There are many great social network methods courses. This course is inspired by a few of them, including Matthew Salganik\u0026rsquo;s Soc 596 at Princeton; James Moody\u0026rsquo;s Seminar on Social Networks at Duke; and previous UW versions of this course taught by, among others, Peter Hoff \u0026amp; Miruna Petrescu-Prahova.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"17e7a15a83f8f8b16982c672a094da7f","permalink":"https://thmccormick.github.io/class/567_sp19/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/class/567_sp19/","section":"class","summary":"Tentative syllabus, subject to change (Updated 17-Feb-2019) Stat/CSSS 566 Spring 2019, University of Washington Course schedule\nLogistics Instructor: Tyler McCormick; Email: tylermc@uw.edu; Office Hours: TBD\nTA: TBD Course meetings: T/Th 11:30-12:50pm (Guggenheim 218) \u0026amp; F 1:30-2:20 (Savery 264) Overview \u0026amp; objectives This course is a practical, hands-on introduction to design and analysis of social network data, set against a backdrop of theory from sociology, economics, and other disciplines.\nCourse components \u0026amp; grading    Component % Grade     Approx 5 HWs 40   In-class presentation 15   Final project \u0026amp; poster 45    In-class presentation: In weeks 3-9, Tuesday lectures will present statistical methods and Thursday lectures will be student presentations of social science papers that use the method.","tags":[],"title":"Statistical analysis of social network data","type":"class"}]
